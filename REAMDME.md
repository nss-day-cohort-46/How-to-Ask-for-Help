# c46 Developer Help Repo

This repository will be used to help instructors and students help each other with coding questions.

Part of being a software developer is formulating good questions. There are many few reasons for this such as are gaining a better understanding what problem you are trying solve, knowing how to interact with senior developers at work, and facilitating your own learning. We want you to be able to effectively articulate problems you are encounter in your code, the output you expect, the output you are getting, solutions you've tried, and what ultimately resolved the issue.
